## Preface

This module represents what we, O.O Designers, live for when it comes to complex solutions, such that perhaps, require a D.D.D approach.
I will be glimpsing some of the basis of this amazing pattern but for more discussion and contribution i gently encourage you to check 
my blog out so we can discuss and make interesting points on this.

Although is not something i came up with, it's appreciated the fact that a manifesto should be declared in order to provide insights of what this pattern stands for.
## Installation

```bash
composer require ticaje/m2-contract
